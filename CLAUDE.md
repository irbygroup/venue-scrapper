# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Eventective CRM lead management for Yellowhammer Hospitality (3 venues: The Hallet-Irby House, Oak & Fountain, The Courtyard on Dauphin). Two components:

1. **`api.py`** — FastAPI + async Playwright HTTP API (`localhost:5050`, all routes at `/eventective/*`)
2. **`scrape_leads.py`** — CLI scraper (full/incremental modes), used manually for recovery only

## Running locally

```bash
# Create venv and install deps
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/playwright install chromium

# Run the API (dev)
.venv/bin/uvicorn api:app --port 5050 --log-level info

# Run incremental sync (CLI scraper)
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 .venv/bin/python scrape_leads.py incremental --db leads.db
```

## Production (vm-mind365)

```bash
# Deploy (build image, sync OpenClaw skill, restart service, health check)
sudo /root/gitops-mind365/tools/deploy-venue-scrapper.sh

# Logs
sudo journalctl -u venue-scrapper -f

# Container shell
docker exec -it venue-scrapper bash

# Connect to venue-scrapper database
psql -U venue_scrapper -d venue_scrapper -h 127.0.0.1
```

## Architecture

### `api.py` — persistent browser, two pages

A single `BrowserManager` instance lives for the lifetime of the process. It holds one `BrowserContext` with **two pages**:
- `sync_page` — stays on the Eventective inbox, makes all JSON API calls via `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`
- `reply_page` — navigates to individual lead message URLs to interact with the Angular reply UI

All Playwright calls go through the same browser context (shared cookies, consistent TLS/fingerprint). On startup, cookies are loaded from the `config` table in the database; on login, new cookies are saved back to the same table.

**Chromium launch flags required for Docker:** `--no-sandbox --disable-setuid-sandbox --disable-dev-shm-usage`

### Smart incremental sync (`POST /eventective/sync`)

The Eventective inbox sidebar is sorted by `LastActivityDttm DESC`. Sync fetches batches of 20 via the `getmessagesforinbox` API. The moment it encounters a lead whose `LastActivityDttm <= last_sync_time`, it stops — everything below is stale. New/changed leads are fetched individually via `geteventdetails`. Last sync time stored in `sync_meta` table.

### Reply flow (`POST /eventective/leads/{id}/reply`)

Navigates `reply_page` to the lead's message URL, types character-by-character (`textarea.type()` not `.fill()` — needed to trigger Angular's change detection so the send button renders), then finds the send button by walking up from the textarea to its `.send-message-wrapper` parent.

### Session / auto-login

`ensure_session()` checks the session, then calls `do_login()` if expired. `do_login()` navigates to `/signin` — if already redirected to the dashboard (valid cookies), returns `True` immediately. Otherwise fills `#Email`/`#Password` and submits.

### Database

PostgreSQL 15 on vm-mind365 (database: `venue_scrapper`, role: `venue_scrapper`). Connection via `DATABASE_URL` env var. Tables:
- `config` — key/value configuration (credentials, URLs, cookies, FUB keys)
- `eventective_leads` — merged inbox metadata + full contact/event details per lead, with FUB tracking fields
- `eventective_lead_activities` — full message thread for each lead, with FUB tracking fields
- `sync_meta` — `last_sync_time` key/value

All config (credentials, URLs, batch sizes) is stored in the `config` table and read at request-time. Only env var needed: `DATABASE_URL`.

**Migration:** `migrate_to_pg.py` is the one-time SQLite→PG migration script. `schema_pg.sql` is the reference PostgreSQL DDL.

### FUB tracking fields

Both `eventective_leads` and `eventective_lead_activities` have:
- `fub_exported` (0/1) — whether the record has been exported to Follow Up Boss
- `fub_exported_date` — when it was exported
- `fub_people_id` — the FUB person ID it was linked to

## API endpoints

See **[API.md](API.md)** for full endpoint documentation with request/response examples.

**IMPORTANT: Always update API.md when endpoints change.**

## Schema management

SQLite schema (for reference/local dev): `schema.sql` — exported via `./export_schema.sh leads.db`
PostgreSQL schema (production): `schema_pg.sql` — manually maintained DDL

**IMPORTANT: After any schema change, update both `schema.sql` (run `export_schema.sh`) and `schema_pg.sql`.**

## Container

Built from `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.50.0-noble`. Uses `DATABASE_URL` env var to connect to PostgreSQL (no local data volume needed). Port `5050` bound to `127.0.0.1` only.

## OpenClaw skill

`openclaw/workspace-events/SKILL.md` — auto-symlinked to `/root/.openclaw/workspace-events/SKILL.md` on deploy. Teaches OpenClaw to call the API endpoints via curl and follow Yellowhammer sales rules (no pricing in messages, always push for phone call at 251-422-9114).

## Sales rules (baked into the skill)

- Never quote pricing — always push for a phone call or tour
- Always mention all 3 venues regardless of which one they inquired about
- Goal: get them on the phone with Veronica Miller at 251-422-9114
- Use assumptive close ("When are you free?") not permission-seeking ("Would you like to call?")
